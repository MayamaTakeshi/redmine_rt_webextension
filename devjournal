we are using web-ext to simplify development:
  npm -g install web-ext

  web-ext run

To build the extension we will use:
  npm run build

We need to create a ws_client object that must abstract ActionCable/Websocket-Rails because if the users changes redmine_url, we will need shutdown the current connection and connect with the new url and it might use a different ws_mode.

Tips for debugging:

Firefox:
  - run 'web-ext run'
  - on the firefox instance that is opened:
    - open a tab to 'about:addons' (set the redmine_url here)
    - open a tab to 'about:debugging' (select redmine_rt_webextension and click 'Debug' to open console to follow events in the webextension)

Chrome:
  - go to chrome://extensions/
  - enable 'Developer mode"
  - Click on unpacked extension and open the folder with the webextension source.
  - To debug 'options', right click on its popup window and select 'inspect'.

Draft:

Startup:
  - check local redmine_url. If set, send channels/session_info request to server. 
  - this should return ws_mode and user_name (login).
  - if there is no login, notify user and switch browser_action to login panel
  - if there is login, switch to loggedin panel (which will have a logout option) and start ws conn

Events:
  - {"event": "redmine_url_saved", "redmine_url": XXX}: compare with current redmine_url. If it is different, close current ws conn and execute Startup procedure
  - {"event": "unauthorized"}: notify user and switch browser_action to login panel
  - {"event": "loggedin"}: restart



Calling 
  http://REDMINE_SERVER/channels/session_info
from within the webextension should return:
  {"ws_mode":"actioncable|websocket-rails","user":"USER_LOGIN_NAME"}
or:
  {"ws_mode":"actioncable|websocket-rails","user":""}
if there is no valid session cookie

Testing on Chrome Version 66.0.3359.139 (Official Build) (64-bit), some options to notifications.create were not working:
  - iconUrl (instead, chrome icon showed up in the notification)
  - imageUrl (no image showed up)

Checking docs:
  https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/notifications#type-NotificationOptions
imageUrl was deprecated.
But iconUrl should have worked.

Obs: about buttons, this chrome version requires to hover over the notification panel for for the buttons to show up. Also hovering out of the panel after hovering in would cause the panel to close.

However, by setting option "requireInteraction" to true, the buttons became visible without need to hovering in and the panel was not dismissed by hovering out.
