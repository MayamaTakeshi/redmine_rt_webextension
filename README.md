# redmine_rt_webextension
Browser webextension to be used with redmine_rt plugin (https://github.com/MayamaTakeshi/redmine_rt).

This webextension connects to redmine_rt using WebSockets and get events from it.

This can be used for CTI (integration with telephony systems like PBXes). 

For example, when a call arrives, the identity of the caller can be shown as a notification popup by the browser.

Then when a call is answered, the Redmine ticket associated with that call can be opened in the browser.
